                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-1">Cancellation </h3>
                    <p class="mb-1">Your policy document will detail your rights to cancel your insurance once you have
                        taken it out. Depending on the type of policy you have purchased, you may be
                        entitled to cancel within 14 or 30 days of either conclusion of the contract or
                        receiving your policy documentation, whichever occurs later. This is often referred
                        to as a cooling off period. Where you cancel a policy before renewal you will be
                        responsible for paying a charge to meet the cost of cover provided and
                        administration expenses. Please see the Refunds section. To enable your insurer to
                        process the cancellation, you will need to return certificates and any official
                        documents to our office within 30 days of your notice to cancel. </p>

                        Where we arrange low or non-commission paying products, we will charge an
                        arrangement fee not exceeding 15% of the premium, and will advise you of the
                        actual amount at the time of quotation or renewal. These fees may be subject to
                        change. Where there are changes, we will confirm this clearly and the actual amount
                        will always be disclosed to you before you commit to purchasing the product.
                        As insurance brokers our remuneration may be as a fee agreed with you or from
                        commission paid to us by insurers based on the amount they charge you. You are
                        entitled, at any time, to request information regarding any commission which we may
                        have received as a result of placing or renewing your insurance cover.
                        We take any commission once we receive your payment as cleared funds and prior
                        to payment of the premium to the insurer. We may occasionally receive additional
                        remuneration from certain insurers for insurance policies we place with them,
                        finance providers claims management services and others. Please ask us should
                        you require further information. Where you choose to pay your premium by
                        instalments, we may use a scheme operated by your insurer, or we may use a
                        single Finance Provider /Finance Provider selected from a limited panel, and we
                        may receive a commission for introducing you to them. The firm will advise the
                        customer of any commission payable by the lender in relation to a credit
                        agreement where knowledge of the existence or amount of commission could affect
                        the impartiality of the firm in recommending a particular product or have a material
                        impact on the customers transactional decision.</p>


                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-1">Refunds </h3>
                    <p class="mb-1">Where a policy is cancelled before renewal, insurers charge to cover their costs,
                        with the balance refunded to you, subject to no claim having been made. Full details will be available in your policy. In the event of an adjustment giving rise to a return of
                        premium the amount may be refunded or held to credit.
                        Your attention is specifically drawn to the following:-Where you cancel
                        your policy after the expiry of the cooling off period or where you request a mid-term
                        adjustment which results in a refund of premium, we reserve the right to charge
                        you for our time and costs. This will usually result in us reducing the amount
                        refunded to you by the FULL amount of the commission and fees we would
                        have received had you not cancelled. The reason for this is that the majority of
                        our costs are incurred either in initially finding and setting up your policy or in the
                        annual renewal process when we might check the ongoing suitability of the cover
                        the policy offers. These costs are recovered through the commission we earn. If you
                        cancel, this does not give us an opportunity to recover the costs we incurred and
                        would often result in us making a loss. However, any charge made will not exceed
                        the cost of the commission and fees we would have earned. For certain commercial
                        insurance policies, insurers will only provide cover where the premium is due in full
                        on inception of the policy. This means that no refund will be paid if the policy is
                        cancelled before renewal. We will advise you if this affects you. In view of the cost
                        involved in making changes to your policy, we will not issue refunds of less than £25 </p>

                    <p class="mb-1">If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in

                        connection with the arranging and administration of your insurance. These Terms
                        constitute an offer by us to act on your behalf in the arranging and administration of

                        This means that you may still be liable for any premium due and not be able to
                        recover the premium paid, whether in full or in part, should an insurer become

                        insurer may be forced to cancel or lapse the relevant policy/policies, which could
                        mean that part or all of a claim may not be paid. You may also be in breach of
                        legally required insurance cover.
                        When renewal is invited and the policy is paid by monthly direct debit, we will issue a
                        notice to you. To ensure you are not left without cover, the absence of a response to
                        this notice will be deemed as your consent to cover being renewed automatically.
                        If you choose to pay for your insurance premium using a finance provider your
                        details will be passed onto them. We will provide you with a breakdown of the costs
                        of your monthly instalments and subsequently a document outlining key features of
                        their credit agreement with you, it is important that you take time to read this
                        document and must contact us if you do not receive this. If you have any queries or
                        questions, either about the service provided by the finance provider or their terms
                        and conditions you should in the first instance contact them. Where your policy is
                        paid via the finance provider and you choose to renew your cover, we will again
                        continue to pass your details to them. If any direct debit or other payment due in
                        respect of any credit agreement you enter into to pay insurance premiums is not met
                        when presented for payment or if you end the credit agreement we will be informed
                        of such events by the finance provider. In certain circumstances we may be
                        contractually obliged by the finance provider to notify your insurer to cancel the
                        policy. Where we are not contractually obliged to do so by the finance provider, if
                        you do not make other arrangements with us to pay the insurance premiums you
                        acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time after being informed of non
                        payment under the credit agreement, instruct on your behalf the relevant insurer to
                        cancel the insurance and to collect any refund of premiums which may be made by
                        the insurer and use this refund to offset the amount levied by the finance provider on
                        the firm. If this amount is not sufficient to cover all our costs we reserve the right to
                        pursue any additional debt owed to the firm through a due legal process.
                        You will be responsible for paying any time on risk charge and putting in place any
                        alternative insurance and/or payment arrangements you need.
                        Upon receiving your strict acceptance to pay for insurance premiums through the
                        finance provider, we will instruct them to proceed with your application for credit.
                        This process will involve the provider searching public information that a credit
                        reference agency holds about you and any previous payment history you have with
                        that provider. The credit reference agency will add details of your search and your
                        application to their record about you whether or not your application is successful.
                        Please read carefully the pre-contractual explanations and the information regarding
                        the cost of credit (including any representative examples). Together they provide
                        important information in relation to the credit facility available from the finance
                        provider. To use the finance providers facility you must be resident in the UK, aged
                        18 years or over and hold a bank or building society current account which can
                        support direct debit payments. Credit is available subject to status.
                        Any payment we receive from you will be held by Moneywise Investments Plc, which
                        pays insurers on our behalf, in a Statutory Client Trust Bank Account held with
                        Natwest and Santander. In some cases the payment we receive will be held on
                        behalf of the provider with whom we arrange your policy as their agent. This means that any payment you make to us will be regarded as having been paid to the
                        provider. This is known as risk transfer.
                        By operating a Statutory Trust Moneywise Investments Plc is not permitted to, and
                        may not use such monies to cross fund clients premiums and claims.
                        Please make all cheques payable to “Moneywise Investments Plc”.
                        By instructing us to place insurance on your behalf you give your informed consent
                        to these Client Money procedures. If there are any matters which you do not
                        understand, or do not accept, you should discuss them with us before proceeding.
                        We may pass the money you pay us to another intermediary. We will only do this
                        where it is a necessary part of the process of arranging cover for you.
                        Where this includes intermediaries outside the UK, the legal and regulatory regime
                        may be different from that of the UK. In the event of the intermediary failing money
                        may be treated differently than if it was held by an intermediary in the UK. You may
                        notify us if you do not wish your money to be passed to a person in a particular
                        jurisdiction.
                        No interest will be payable to customers in respect of the client account. Any
                        interest earned will remain in the ownership of Moneywise Investments Plc. </p>
